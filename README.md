# Facial-Recognition-Attendance-System

This project aims to automate attendance tracking by using facial recognition technology. The system will capture and recognize faces of individuals in a given environment (like a classroom or workplace) to mark attendance. The main components include a webcam for real-time image capture, a facial recognition algorithm (using libraries like OpenCV), and a database to store user information and attendance records.
